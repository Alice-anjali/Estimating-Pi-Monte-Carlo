# Estimating-Pi-Monte-Carlo
Estimating the value of &#960; using Monte Carlo for various set of points and comparing it with the actual value of &#960;

Monte Carlo simulations are computational algorithms that depend on sampling of random numbers.
Taking a circle of radius 1 at the origin, random points are generated within an imaginary square of side 2 at the same origin.
Explanation of the maths behind the logic is given in [this](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/estimating-value-pi-using-monte-carlo/) link.

Below are the example outputs for the number of random points 100, 500 and 5000. Comparison of the actual value of &#960; and the estimated value of &#960; is done for all three.
